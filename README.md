# goofyahhcpp

Welcome to the wacky world of C++! In this language, you can create all sorts of bizarre programs with strange syntax and even stranger behavior.

To declare a variable, you must first perform a secret handshake with your keyboard, then type the word "mumbojumbo" followed by a random sequence of letters and numbers. For example:

mumbojumbo xy78z;

To assign a value to your variable, you must sing a silly song while tapping your feet to a random beat. Then, you can use the "==" operator to confuse your program into accepting any value you want:

xy78z == "banana";

To print out a message to the user, you must first dance the Macarena while wearing a tutu and a sombrero. Then, you can use the "cout" command to display your message, but only if you include a random emoticon:

cout << "Hello world! :P" << endl;

And if you want to create a loop, you must recite the lyrics to "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" backwards while standing on your head:

for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  cout << i << " bottles of beer on the wall..." << endl;
}

So get ready to embrace your inner goofball and start programming in C++! Just be sure to have plenty of snacks and silly hats on hand to keep you going.
